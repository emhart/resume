### Experience

**Apple**   *Senior Data Scientist - Product Analytics*   **2014 - Present**
	Deploy machine learning models at scale in a production environment to provide meaningful business prediction.
	Build forecasting models for various lines of business to help with new initiatives.
	Collaborate with cross-functional teams to ensure proper instrumentation of products and build data pipelines.
	Deliver insightful presentations of analysis and business results to business unit leaders.

**University of Vermont** *Adjunct Research Faculty* **2015 - Present**
	Develop and support open source scientific software for statistical analysis of ecological communities.
	Provide workshops on scientific computing best practices for graduate students.

**National Ecological Observatory**   *Staff Scientist*   **2013 to 2014**
	Implemented a data and metadata standards across a 1,000 data products for an NSF funded ecological obseveratory.
	Created programmatic tools for interacting with data in a variety of data platforms (Neo4J, CouchDB, SQL) for other scientists.
	Developed and tested algorithms to quantify uncertainty in raw sensor network data and scale up to synthetic data products.

**University of British Columbia Beaty Biodiversity Center**   *Post-Doctoral Fellow*   **2011 to 2013**
	Developed individual based models of the evolution of sociality in spiders using evolutionary algorithms in Python.
	Built large scale simulations of spider populations to calculate error and bias properties of statistical models of population growth.

**University of Vermont Complex Systems Group**   *Graduate Research Fellow*   **2005 to 2011**
	Built statistical models of toxic algal bloom population dynamics based on historical monitoring data.
  	Collaborated with a diverse group of engineers, computer scientists and biologists on using complex systems methods to analyze ecological data.

### Projects

* **[The Carpentries Foundation](https://carpentries.org/)**	
	The Carpentries teach foundational coding, and data science skills to researchers worldwide. I teach workshops at universities and scientific institutions on based on the Carpentries curriculum about python, R, data visualization, SQL, and version control. I have also developed numerous lessons, including ones on R, SQL, and spatial data analysis.

* **[rOpenSci Project](https://ropensci.org/)**
	rOpensci is community based project that builds open source software tools for the scientific community. I develop and maintain numerous open source software packages for scientific data and computing. I have also been a code reviewer for software submitted to the project, and contributed blog posts, curriculum for workshop,s and helped write grants and academic articles.

* **[DataCamp](https://datacamp.com/)**
	Datacamp teaches people data science online in small interactive online lessons. I contribute and maintain curriculum for a lesson called "Case studies in network theory", teaching students the application of basic network theory through a series of video and online exercises.
